# Project Abstract
The developed AI software focuses on enhancing the diagnostic processes in healthcare. The AI is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising of various symptoms associated with common diseases. The AI predicts which disease the person is most likely suffering from based on their presented symptoms. 

The main focus of the project is to improve efficiency in healthcare, saving both time and efforts of healthcare professionals and empowering patients to participate actively in their healthcare journey. It is important to emphasize that the software is not intended to replace healthcare professionals, but rather to complement them and serve as a valuable tool to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

On the development of this project, I have designed, tested, and compared six different AI models. This rigorous evaluation aimed to elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of each model so as to choose an AI model that would work best for the given problem and dataset. By harnessing the potential of AI, ultimately, this software represents a promising leap forward in healthcare to revolutionise medical decision-making, reduce errors and optimize healthcare resources.
